	points for empty days (needs to include from fringe start to first show and last show to fringe end)

my schedule
	add tri-select
	option to hide maybes

tickets buying screen
	mark tickets as bought
	select tickets to buy
		auto populate cart???
		mark tickets bought (optional deselect)

progressbar in nav to encourage exploring?
	welcome modal, optional tell about each page the first land

context sensitive help

speed up generator by creating fake performance ids which are the actual sort order
    then the sort function doesn't need a callback

store using token id instead of plain id

store in anonymous session
on sign-in
    if new account, store
    otherwise if there are preferences or a schedule in anonymous
        Signing-in will remove current and restore saved. Continue?
            if not, sign out
            if so, restore
