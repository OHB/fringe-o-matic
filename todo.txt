schedule gen hooray schedule is full says that when it's empty if there's no shows with interest to look at
	check actual availability -> your schedule has room for more shows if you'd be interested
	check my availability -> there are more shows if you can make more time


how to let the scheduler continue after finding a match in order to see about a better match?
	minimum # of generations
	extra generations after fitness increase
	update progress bar to match with that
	store data in userData???
	gen stop disabled for now

need a better way of determining population/generation
	

i need the extra points for empty days
	this is tricky
	points for close together (current does venue distance, but it should only apply if the two performances are close together in the schedule)
	points for empty days (needs to include from fringe start to first show and last show to fringe end)

scheduler auto select is fucked and it also needs upgraded to include maybe
