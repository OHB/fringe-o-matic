no ticket links for free shows

auto-scheduler
    after done
    find shows with conflicts
    shuffle
    attempt to add to proposed schedule using shuffled performance order

    OR

    calculate fitness taking this into account???
        pass in shuffled shows with shuffled performances
        make a not conflicts list = []
        for each conflict, if it doesn't conflict with something in the no conflicts list,
            add fitness
            add to not conflicts list
        if getdetails, return not conflicts list
        when processing, use not conflicts list and add to scheduled and accept

extra points for empty days! + 100?

after generate, manually check unscheduled for possible performances?

generate result infos

my schedule
	as calendar (google, ical, etc?)



ticket links to my schedule


when floriduh was scheduled it auto accepted the ladies of the peekaboo lounge at same time 24th 11:59p


schedule gen hooray schedule is full says that when it's empty if there's no shows with interest to look at
	check actual availability -> your schedule has room for more shows if you'd be interested
	check my availability -> there are more shows if you can make more time


how to let the scheduler continue after finding a match in order to see about a better match?
	minimum # of generations
	extra generations after fitness increase
	update progress bar to match with that
	store data in userData???
	gen stop disabled for now

need a better way of determining population/generation
	

i need the extra points for empty days
	this is tricky
	points for close together (current does venue distance, but it should only apply if the two performances are close together in the schedule)
	points for empty days (needs to include from fringe start to first show and last show to fringe end)

scheduler auto select is fucked and it also needs upgraded to include maybe

my schedule
	add tri-select
	option to hide maybes

schedule pin top previous/next buttons, remove lower

tickets buying screen
	mark tickets as bought
	select tickets to buy
		auto populate cart???
		mark tickets bought (optional deselect)


bingo reminder
progressbar in nav to encourage exploring?
	welcome modal, optional tell about each page the first land
