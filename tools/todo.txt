lawn things
same services?
which tree?

patron's picks

allow multiple performances to be manually added
    warn when adding #2 only (don't warn when adding 3rd performance of a given show)


IDEAS:
    customizable auto-scheduler
    kids-day. Choose a day on which to clump kids shows
    for a scheduled show, find another time for a single show

content loading / loaded directive
    transclude content on load, surely this works even though directive needs scope!

availableTime = 2.start - 1.end - offset(1, 2) - arrivalThreshold

if availableTime >= 120
	maybe lunch/dinner
if availableTime >= 90
	maybe lunch/dinner
		suggest lawn if after is in fringe central
		otherwise, suggest a restaurant

if availableTime >= 45
	snack/drink
if availableTime >= 30
	if crossing the lawn, snack or drink


lunch happens 11-2
dinner happens 5-7

when there's back-to-back shows (<30 minutes between each) and a gap before:
	3 shows: eat first
	4 shows: also bring snacks
