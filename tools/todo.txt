BUG
Go to Schedule
Click a link to another page
doesn't work
click another, it works.
(first always fails)
related to url update
push state?

css instead of innerHeight

content loading / loaded directive
    transclude content on load, surely this works even though directive needs scope!

make mobile friendly!
    DONE: Menu, Privacy, Credits, Venues, Shows, Home, My Fringe, Schedule, Show, Map, My Availability
    TO DO: My Schedule, Auto-Scheduler

custom reminder popover

no ticket links for free shows

i need the extra points for empty days
	this is tricky
	points for close together (current does venue distance, but it should only apply if the two performances are close together in the schedule)
	points for empty days (needs to include from fringe start to first show and last show to fringe end)



tickets buying screen?
	mark tickets as bought
	select tickets to buy
		auto populate cart???
		mark tickets bought (optional deselect)
