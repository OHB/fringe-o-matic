lawn things
same services?
which tree?

patron's picks

Show screen. Image needs to be square

allow multiple performances to be manually added
    warn when adding #2 only (don't warn when adding 3rd performance of a given show)

click header to toggle day (availability)

BUG
Go to Schedule
Click a link to another page
doesn't work
click another, it works.
(first always fails)
related to url update
push state?

content loading / loaded directive
    transclude content on load, surely this works even though directive needs scope!

no ticket links for free shows

i need the extra points for empty days
	this is tricky
	points for close together (current does venue distance, but it should only apply if the two performances are close together in the schedule)
	points for empty days (needs to include from fringe start to first show and last show to fringe end)



tickets buying screen?
	mark tickets as bought
	select tickets to buy
		auto populate cart???
		mark tickets bought (optional deselect)

availableTime = 2.start - 1.end - offset(1, 2) - arrivalThreshold

if availableTime >= 120
	maybe lunch/dinner
if availableTime >= 90
	maybe lunch/dinner
		suggest lawn if after is in fringe central
		otherwise, suggest a restaurant

if availableTime >= 45
	snack/drink
if availableTime >= 30
	if crossing the lawn, snack or drink


lunch happens 11-2
dinner happens 5-7

when there's back-to-back shows (<30 minutes between each) and a gap before:
